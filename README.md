Stuck-in-the-Hoohah
===================

This is where I'm storing the revisions of the script of my one man show, "Stuck in the Hoohah".

I originally wrote and performed this show at the Vancouver Fringe Festival at the Anza Club in September, 1991.

For various reasons, (mostly having to do with my infinite capacity for procrastination) I wrote it very quickly (about 10 days, if memory serves) while in Seattle.
I got the idea for the show from a friend of mine, Tim Hyland. He told me about someone he knew who had accidentally locked homself in his bathroom. His wife let him out when she got home from work, but he'd been in there for three or four hours.
I then had less than a week to rehearse it before throwing it up on the stage.
