Stuck-in-the-Hoohah
===================

This is where I'm storing the revisions of the script of my one man show, "Stuck in the Hoohah".

I originallly wrote and performed this show at the Vanocuver Fringe Festival at the Anza Club in September, 1991.

For various reasons, (mostly having to do with my infinite capacity for procrastination) I wrote it very quickly (about 10 days, if memory serves) while in Seattle.
I then had less than a week to rehearse it before throwing it up on the stage.
